# Hardware

Your daughter board should have shipped with 4 spacers which should be screwed
into four mounting holes on the Replay 1 base board. The daughter board's mounting
holes should then line up with these spacers.

When mounting the daughter board pay attention to the header socket underneath
the board which should connect with the two header pins (P2) on the base board.
Marked as "Alternative 5V input" in the image below.

Once the daughter board fits snuggly into the expansion socket, fasten into place
with the four spacers.

## USB Ports

Three USB ports are provided, two as USB 2.0 sockets and a third exposed
via the five header pins (P13) just behind the two sockets.
