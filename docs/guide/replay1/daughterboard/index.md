![Replay1 Board Overview](/images/replay1/daughterboard.jpg "Replay 1 daughter board")

The 68K daughter board expands the capabilities of the Replay 1 by providing
a socket for an optional 68060 CPU and 128MB local/fastram for use by the 68060.

In addition, a floppy drive can be attached (for use with supporting cores), making
this an ideal upgrade for Amiga / AtariST enthusiasts.

The board also expands the Replayâ€™s I/O capabilities with a second SD card
slot (dedicated to the FPGA), 100Mbit Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports, a real time clock,
audio in socket (24-bit 96KHz stereo ADC) and Midi I/O interface.

::: tip Note
Daughter board capabilities depend cores support. Audio In Record & Sampling will
be driver and core dependent.
