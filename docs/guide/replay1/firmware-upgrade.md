# Firmware Upgrade

The latest Replay Firmware can currently be be downloaded from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FPGAArcade/replay_release/tree/master/firmware/replay1)
repo.

The zip contains two folders which correspond to the two different methods you
can use to update your Replay's firmware.

::: tip Note
If your Replay's existing firmware is _very_ old or your Replay's firmware
is corrupt, you may be unable to use either of these methods. All is not
lost, instructions to recover will be added soon(tm).
