# Overview

The Replay board is a high quality base platform for the development and usage
of “cores“.

Whilst no longer in production, if you have managed to get your hands on one,
the [Hardware](./hardware) section covers the additional items needed to connect
and use your Replay board with a TV or Monitor.

Once connected and powered on (without an SD card inserted) you should be
greeted by the embeded loader core. The embedded loader does not currently offer
many features but provides a useful way to verify your board is working without
the added complication of running a core from the SD card.

If you have a blank screen/no video signal, please refer to the
[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) section for assistance.

::: tip Note
Recent cores require an up to date firmware. Refer to the
[Firmware Upgrade](./firmware-upgrade) instructions to check your firmware
version and update.

Now you know your board works, it's time to download and configure the
"cores" that enable your Replay to recreate arcade machines, home computers
and gaming consoles. The [SD Setup](./sd-setup) section covers this step.

<!-- TODO: Configuration details to cover ini file tweaks that may be needed -->

If all has gone well, you should now be all set to lose yourself in endless
hours of retro gaming and computer use. Enjoy! If your setup hasn't gone so
well, check out the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) section or
