>>How do I get the Vidor into Upload mode.

To put the Vidor into upload mode, quickly push the **button twice.
If successful, the LED will flash smoothly to indicate that the board is in bootloader mode.

Note: **The button for this operation is below the hat for the sd card.

>>How do I flash with a later firmware.

Q. Im getting a library named replay_mkrvidor4000 already exists and replay isn’t displayed in library manager
when I try to flash with a later firmware, or I just need to update to a later firmware version.

A. At this time, the only way is to manually delete the old imported library and then import the new version from scratch.
So for the Vidor, under your Arduino IDE select the menu option “File”, “Preferences” and check the “Sketchbook location”.
Close the Arduino IDE. Open this path in file browser and go to library folder. Now Delete the folder replay_mkrvidor4000.
B. Next repeat the steps from step 4 above to update to your newer version.
