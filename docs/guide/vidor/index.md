# Overview

::: warning Draft
This documentation is a work in progress and has not been reviewed for accuracy.

The Vidor platform target is also in-development and support/features are
subject to change.

Proceed at your own risk.
:::

The MKR Vidor 4000 is a low cost small form factor development board by Arduino.

This guide aims to provide you with just enough information to get started
running supported "FPGA Arcade" cores on your Vidor.

::: tip Note
Whilst the FPGA Arcade system runs on the Vidor, it is an entry level device and
as such, there may be limitations compared to the Replay system. Also, keep in mind that
as an Arduino product, the Vidor expects a more hands-on approach.
:::

Before you can get started, you'll need a few additional [accessories](./accessories.md) to
make use of the Vidor with the FPGA Arcade firmware.

The [firmware](./firmware.md) section covers loading the FPGA Arcade firmware
onto the device "Arduino Style". You may also want to review the official
Arduino [Getting Started Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MKRVidor4000).

If all has gone well, you should be all set to lose yourself in endless
hours of retro gaming and computer use with your Vidor 4000. Enjoy! If your setup
hasn't gone so well, check out the [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) section and
consider joining our active [community](/community.md) for support.
