# Community

You can reach the replay team and community via the
[FPGA Arcade forum](http://www.fpgaarcade.com/punbb/).

In addition we have an active Slack channel where most discussion now takes
place. Whilst invite only, Replay board owners are encouraged to join and can
request an invite via the [FPGA Arcade forum](http://www.fpgaarcade.com/punbb/).
