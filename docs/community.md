# Community

You can reach the replay team and community via the

In addition we have an active [Slack channel](https://fpgaarcade.slack.com/)
where most discussion now takes place. Whilst invite only, Replay board owners
are encouraged to join and can request an invite via the
[FPGA Arcade forum](https://www.fpgaarcade.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=1241).
